# Film_review_website

This project is split across two git repositories.
- [P1_Film_review_webiste](https://github.com/Maciejw52/Film_review_website) is the frontend/client side built with React js utilising axios and other libraries
- [P1_Express_Api_Server](https://github.com/Maciejw52/P1_Express_Api_Server) is the backend/server-side built with Express.js and Node.js built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) software architecture

The general purpose of this project is to learn and get familiar with frontend and backend JavaScript development to build a film review website using the popular MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack. For this project, I used MongoDB Atlas to host the database and Heroku to host my Express server and my client server.
